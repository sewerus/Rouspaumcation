# Rouspaumcation
Simulation program designed to solve problem of dynamic routing, space and spectrum allocation (RSSA) of unicast demands in flex-grid network with assistive sotrage.

Needed data set:
- .net file with network dimensions: number of nodes, links and adjacent matrix,
- .pat file with k candidate paths (k can be set up in code),
- .spec file with number of slices needed for each path in .pat file,
- .dem files with demands (income iteration, source, target, bitrate and duration).
